### Estimating the juvenile biological profile

Goal: The purpose of this project is to develop and test methods for estimating various parameters of the juvenile biological profile for use in both bioarchaeological and forensic contexts. What methods do practitioners need? Should we develop population specific or universal methods? How well do existing methods perform across target population? Key collaborators include Hugo Cardoso (SFU) and John Albanese (UWindsor).

Data for these studies include: skeletal data from CT scans of children from the US; skeletal measurements and dental x-rays from identified skeletal collections across the Europe and the US.

### Project status

Work on this topic is ongoing. Data has largely been collected, although there are opportunities for students to do additional data collection. There may also be opportunities for students to analyze these data.
