### The Evolutionary Demography of Religion

Our team collaborates on the Evolutionary Demography of Religion project, a mixed-method cross-cultural project. Learn more about the project and the full team [here](https://www.evolutionarydemographyofreligion.org/).

Goal: In post-industrial societies, the number of children in a family is negatively correlated with each child's success. In these same settings, religious families tend to have more children than their secular counterparts - and yet children from religious families do not exhibit the negative consequences of larger family sizes. The project team hypothesizes that religious families are able to achieve this through increased collaboration with each other, particularly in the form of childcare.

The project is funded by the John Templeton Foundation and the Templeton Religion Trust, grants awarded to project PIs: John Shaver, Richard Sosis, Rebecca Sear, and Mary Shenk.


### Project status

The first round of data collection for this project is complete. Currently, we are designing a second round of data collection in the Gambia, in which we will re-visit a subset of participants and their children.
